# US CITY SDG INDEX AND DASHBOARDS REPORT 2018  
## Leaving No U.S. City Behind: The 2018 U.S. Cities SDGs Index
US City-level data from 2018 Index and Dashboards

## Report Description
This 2nd annual report from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) ranks the 100 most populous metropolitan areas in the U.S. on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  It is particularly relevant for urban leaders whose engagement is crucial for sustainable development, as 85% of the U.S. population live in cities.

The Index report analyzes 44 indicators for each city to provide a comprehensive assessment of sustainable development challenges related to environmental, social, and economic objectives.  It is intended as a planning tool for cities, highlighting areas of strength and weakness and where opportunities exist to learn from other cities.  It includes a quick-reference dashboard that rates each cityâ€™s performance on 15 of the 17 SDGs, as well as a series of maps showing relative performance in different parts of the country.
